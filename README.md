#	<Unit1-Mini-Proj>

##	Description

Originally, this work on this project began as a practice webpage to assist in my learning the various skills being taught in the Coding Bootcamp class. However, as more and more time and effort were placed into producing this webpage, along with the need to use components of more advanced programming, I turned this work in to the project that was required in Unit 1. Therefore, the project resulted in being created to fulfill both personal and classroom goals  using HTML, CSS, VS Code, Git, Github, and Terminal rather than the PC UI. 

The specific topic for this webpage was chosen related to a hobby of mine, hiking. I found myself being more engaged since this is something that interests me. 

The project solves the problem of learning concepts of HTML and CSS and how to use both to create a webpage that is inviting, unique, and practices satisfying goals that a client might ask for. 

I learned so much it is difficult to describe in this README. I spent countless hours using class resources, web searches, tutoring, live assistants, and simple trial and error. This amounted to being consumed in this project for several days, looking to integrate more advanced techniques to make the project even better. In all, although I am satisfied with the outcome, it does not seem as jaw-dropping wonderful as I had hoped for something that took so long and so much work to produce. 

The steps required to start the development environment running include: opening VS Code, Github, Git (and Terminal). Once the project has been created on my local repo then it must be linked to Github to save changes as the program develops. In Github, a remote repo is created and linked via Git (to the local repo as just stated). Once this link is made using several Git terminal commands, the project is “off and running.” The project is created in VS Code. It is here that the bulk of time spent designing is spent. Again, following this step, the project and changes are uploaded to Github. The final project is then deployed to the web.
